## Using Transfer Learning and TensorFlow 2.0 to Classify Different Dog Breeds
To do this, we'll be using [data from the Kaggle dog breed](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification/data). It consists of a collection of 10,000+ labelled images of 120 different dog breeds.

This kind of problem is called multi-class image classification. It's multi-class because we're trying to classify mutliple different breeds of dog.
